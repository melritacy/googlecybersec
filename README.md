Professional Statement Outline

My name is Melrita Cyriac. I am currently a third year student at the University of Alberta. I am a passionate , committed and highly motivated cybersecurity analyst. I place immense importance in protecting the world around us through one's security posture.

I am keen on on safeguarding organizations and people alike through stringent security measures and actively working on one's security defense and mitigating risk through any means possible.

Cybersecurity stood out to me due the strong ethics required to be in a field. As someone who is passionate about technology and holds myself to high ethical standards , it was imperative to me that the field I placed myself in reflected who I am as an indiviual.
